# Recipe Management Application

## Overview
The **Recipe Management Application** is a web-based platform designed to help users organize, store, and manage their favorite recipes. Whether you're a home cook, food enthusiast, or professional chef, this app provides a simple and intuitive way to save recipes with essential details like ingredients, cooking instructions, preparation time, and images. Users can also categorize, search, and filter recipes for easy access.

This project was developed as part of my internship to demonstrate my skills in **React.js**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and modern web development practices.
